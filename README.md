# Stata-tables-in-R
Some dirty code to replicate stata code in R as well as produce LaTeX tables using Stargazer

The stata do file creates a bunch of tables in Stata as well as LaTeX, and the R markdown file does the exact same thing but cleaner. 
A number of packages are employed, but the main focus is on lfe, texreg and stargazer.
